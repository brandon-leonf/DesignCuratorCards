# Student Reflection

This project showed me that AI outputs must be verified. I learned to use prompts to explore, then verify facts with real sources. The expert critique helped me refine tone and vocabulary. I challenged AI claims by checking museum sites and archives. This process taught me that AI is useful for drafting, but responsibility for accuracy is mine.
